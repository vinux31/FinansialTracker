# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Personal Finance Tracker**
**Audited:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** TECH DEBT — All core requirements met, Phase 5 deferred

---

## Executive Summary

Milestone v1.0 delivers a fully functional personal finance tracker with expense/income tracking, visual dashboards, authentication, investment portfolio management, and financial goal planning. All implemented phases pass verification with zero critical integration gaps.

**The gap:** Phase 5 (Enhanced Tracking Features) was intentionally deferred. The 7 ENH requirements remain unimplemented. In its place, Phase 6 (Financial Planning & Goal Tracking) was designed and completed as a bonus — delivering 8 goal-tracking features not in the original requirements.

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Score | Status |
|-------|----------------|-------|--------|
| 01-foundation-core-tracking | Missing (01-04-SUMMARY.md is verification) | 10/10 flows | ✓ Passed |
| 02-dashboard-visualization | ✓ Present | 17/17 truths | ✓ Passed |
| 03-authentication-multi-device-sync | ✓ Present | 4/4 truths | ✓ Passed |
| 04-investment-portfolio-tracking | ✓ Present | 5/5 truths | ✓ Passed |
| 05-enhanced-tracking-features | ✗ Not started | — | Deferred |
| 06-financial-planning-goal-tracking | ✓ Present | 6/6 truths | ✓ Passed |

**Note — Phase 1 VERIFICATION.md:** Not formally created. Plan 04 (01-04-SUMMARY.md) performed manual verification of all 7 user flows and all CORE-01 through CORE-10 requirements. All passed. This is not a blocker, but a formal VERIFICATION.md was never written.

**Note — Phase 3 UAT:** 2 issues found during UAT (React Hooks violation in MonthlyPage). Fixed in Phase 03-05. Final verification status: passed.

**Note — Phase 6 UAT:** 1 blocker found during UAT (generic "Failed to create goal" error). Fixed in Phase 06-05 (InsertGoalSchema validation). Final verification status: passed.

## Integration Check Results

**Spawned:** gsd-integration-checker
**Result:** 100% pass — no integration gaps

### Wiring Coverage: 20/20 exports used

All db.ts exports active, all component exports rendered, all type definitions used.

### E2E Flows: 6/6 complete

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| New user signup → first expense → today view | ✓ Complete |
| Monthly financial review (expenses + charts + investments) | ✓ Complete |
| Investment tracking → portfolio view → monthly summary | ✓ Complete |
| Goal planning → timeline → KPI dashboard | ✓ Complete |
| Full CSV export (transactions + investments + goals + progress) | ✓ Complete |
| localStorage migration → Supabase → data preserved | ✓ Complete |

### Auth Protection: 6/6 routes guarded

All (dashboard)/* routes protected by server-side layout auth check. Middleware refreshes tokens on every request.

### Data Isolation: Verified

Every CRUD function calls getUserId(). All queries filter by user_id. Update/delete operations verify ownership. RLS policies enforce auth.uid() = user_id at database level.

### Cross-Phase Integration: No gaps

- Phase 01 types used throughout all phases
- Phase 02 charts correctly consume Phase 01 + Phase 03 data
- Phase 03 db.ts properly replaces Phase 01 storage.ts
- Phase 04 extends export.ts and monthly view without regressions
- Phase 06 extends export.ts, db.ts, and dashboard without regressions

## Tech Debt Summary

### By Phase

**Phase 01 — Foundation:**
- Missing formal VERIFICATION.md (minor procedural gap)

**Phase 05 — Enhanced Tracking (deferred):**
- ENH-01: Yearly summary — users cannot see annual totals or month-by-month averages
- ENH-02: Category trend visualization — no time-series view for individual categories
- ENH-03: Recurring expense templates — must re-enter frequent expenses manually
- ENH-04: Budget limits per category — no spending limits (explicitly deferred in PROJECT.md)
- ENH-05: Budget alerts — no notifications when approaching limits (explicitly deferred)
- ENH-06: Dark mode — app only supports light mode
- ENH-07: Keyboard shortcuts — no keyboard-based expense entry shortcuts

**Total deferred items: 7 across 1 phase (Phase 5)**

## Success Criteria Assessment

From REQUIREMENTS.md milestone goals:

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| User logs expenses in under 5 seconds | ✓ Achieved (verified in Phase 01 UAT) |
| User can see today's spending at a glance | ✓ Achieved |
| User can view monthly spending breakdown by category | ✓ Achieved |
| User can track income and investments alongside expenses | ✓ Achieved |
| User can export all data as CSV | ✓ Achieved (transactions + investments + goals) |
| Application runs on 100% free hosting (Vercel + Supabase) | ✓ Architecture confirmed |

**All 6 success criteria: MET**

---

## Verdict

**Status: TECH DEBT**

All core success criteria are met. All implemented phases pass verification. Cross-phase integration is clean with no broken flows. Phase 5 (Enhanced Tracking) was intentionally deferred — the 7 ENH requirements remain as backlog items.

**What was built:**
- Complete personal finance tracker (Phases 1–4, 6)
- Fast expense entry (<5 seconds) with category visualization
- Supabase authentication with multi-device sync
- Investment portfolio tracking with CSV export
- Financial goal planning with timeline and KPI dashboard

**What was deferred:**
- Yearly summaries, category trends, recurring templates, budgets, dark mode, keyboard shortcuts (Phase 5)

**Bonus delivered:**
- Financial Planning & Goal Tracking (Phase 6) — not in original requirements, fully functional

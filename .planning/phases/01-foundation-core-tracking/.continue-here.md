<context>
Executing Phase 1 completion verification. All code implementation is done (plans 01-01 through 01-03).
Plan 01-04 is a special verification checkpoint that requires manual user testing before marking Phase 1 complete.
This ensures all CORE requirements (01-10) work correctly before moving to Phase 2 (Dashboard & Visualization).

The dev server is running without errors. The application builds successfully. Just need user to test the flows.

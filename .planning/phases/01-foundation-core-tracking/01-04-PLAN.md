<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run build and fix any integration issues</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Run `npm run build` in the project root. If there are any TypeScript errors, import issues, or build failures from Plans 02 and 03 running in parallel, fix them.

    Common integration issues to check:
    - Import path conflicts between components
    - Missing re-exports from shared modules
    - Duplicate layout.tsx files (root vs dashboard route group)
    - Navigation links pointing to correct routes (/history, /monthly)

    If build passes cleanly, start the dev server: `npm run dev`

    Verify the application loads at http://localhost:3000 without console errors.
  </action>
  <verify>
    `npm run build` passes. `npm run dev` starts without errors. Application loads at http://localhost:3000.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Application builds and runs without errors. All pages accessible via navigation.

  <name>Task 2: Verify all Phase 1 user flows</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Present the following verification checklist to the user for manual testing.

    What was built:
    - Quick expense entry form (Today page)
    - Today's spending summary
    - Income logging (History page)
    - Transaction history list
    - Monthly summary with category breakdown
    - CSV export
    - Navigation between all views

    User should test with `npm run dev` at http://localhost:3000:

    1. Quick expense entry (CORE-01, CORE-07, CORE-09): Amount field auto-focused, type "15000", keep category "Makan", submit. Today's total updates to "Rp 15.000". Form resets.
    2. Today's spending view (CORE-03): Today's date displayed, total spending prominent, add another expense (5000 Transportasi), total updates to "Rp 20.000".
    3. Navigation: Click History -> /history, Monthly -> /monthly, Today -> /. Active link highlighted.
    4. Income logging (CORE-02): On History page, enter amount "5000000", notes "Salary", submit. Appears in list as income.
    5. Transaction history (CORE-05): Shows all transactions sorted newest first with date, type, category, amount, notes.
    6. CSV export (CORE-06): Click export button, CSV downloads, open in Excel -- headers and Indonesian category names correct.
    7. Monthly summary (CORE-04): Shows current month totals (expenses, income, net) and per-category breakdown for all 5 categories.
  </action>
  <verify>
    User confirms all 7 verification flows pass. Type "approved" or describe issues.
  </verify>
  <done>
    All Phase 1 user flows verified and approved by user. CORE-01 through CORE-10 requirements satisfied.
  </done>
</task>
